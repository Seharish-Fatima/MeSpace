        <h2>The Plot Twist: FAST CS Girl Era</h2>
        <p>
          It began with a seven-year-old girl who couldn’t spell “neurosurgeon,”
          but felt the weight of that dream in her chest like it was stitched
          into her stars.
        </p>

        <p>
          For years, that was the plan. White coats. Operating rooms. A mind
          that heals minds. But somewhere between O Levels and late-night
          overthinking, reality hit. It wasn’t just about hard work — it was
          about time. About sacrificing too many years to become something more
          than just another MBBS.
        </p>

        <p>
          And the thing is, I never wanted ordinary. I wanted legacy. Impact.
          Magic. And I wanted it on my terms.
        </p>

        <p>
          So I pivoted. Pre-engineering happened. And then, almost by accident —
          code. It wasn’t love at first sight, not yet. But it sparked
          something. A flicker. A whisper that said,
          <em>“You can build worlds here too.”</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          I entered FAST not entirely convinced — just curious enough to see
          where this could go. And then… the twist. A data science internship.
          That was the moment everything shifted.
        </p>

        <p>
          Because suddenly, it wasn’t just code anymore. It was meaning. It was
          truth written in numbers, waiting to be uncovered. It was storytelling
          — not with words, but with patterns, insights, questions that
          mattered. And it made sense to me in a way the rest of the world
          didn’t always.
        </p>

        <p>
          That’s when I fell in love. First with data. Then with design. With
          making things real. With turning logic into experience, and numbers
          into narratives.
        </p>

        <p>
          So no, I didn’t become a neurosurgeon. But I still study minds — just
          in different ways. I still dissect stories — just hidden in datasets.
          And I still heal, in my own way — by building, understanding,
          creating.
        </p>

        <p>
          That’s the real beginning. Not a perfect plan, but a beautifully
          chaotic rewrite. A reminder that sometimes, the dream isn’t wrong — it
          just shows up in a different language.
        </p>

        <h2>The First Spark: Feeling the Data</h2>

        <p>
          There’s a difference between understanding something and feeling it.
        </p>

        <p>
          I knew how to code. I could write the loops, the functions, the
          algorithms.
        </p>

        <p>
          But it wasn’t until I touched data — real, messy, beautiful data —
          that I realized:
        </p>

        <p>
          This wasn’t just math. This wasn’t just tech. This was storytelling.
        </p>

        <p>
          Suddenly, every number wasn’t just a value.<br />
          It was a question.<br />
          A choice.<br />
          A hidden heartbeat.
        </p>

        <p>
          It didn’t happen all at once. There wasn’t a lightning bolt, a big
          fanfare, a cinematic swell of music.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was quieter than that.<br />
          It was subtle.<br />
          It was sacred.
        </p>

        <p>
          It started the day I stared at a spreadsheet — rows and rows of
          sterile, soulless numbers — and somehow... I didn’t just see data
          anymore.
        </p>

        <p>I saw stories.</p>

        <p>
          I saw late nights and broken systems. I saw human choices and
          consequences stitched between the 1s and 0s. I saw dreams abandoned,
          promises made, failures hidden in plain sight.
        </p>

        <p>And for the first time, I realized:</p>

        <p>
          Data isn't numbers.<br />
          It’s memory.<br />
          It’s humanity.
        </p>

        <p>
          And if I was brave enough, I could be the one to listen. I could be
          the one to tell the stories no one else even knew were there.
        </p>

        <p>
          That was the moment something ancient and hungry inside me stirred — A
          whisper that said:
        </p>

        <p>
          <em
            >“You were never meant to just exist inside their systems. You were
            meant to translate the invisible. To witness. To build. To
            rebel.”</em
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          And I knew it wasn’t about code anymore. It wasn’t even about career
          paths, or impressing professors, or chasing grades.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was about truth. About creation. About wielding knowledge like a
          blade and a balm.
        </p>

        <p>
          That was my true beginning.<br />
          Not the neat little resume bullet point.<br />
          Not the "internship experience" section.
        </p>

        <p>No.</p>

        <p>
          That was the night I fell in love — not with a language or a platform
          — but with the idea that I could shape the future simply by deciding
          to see what others ignored.
        </p>

        <p>
          Quietly.<br />
          Unapologetically.<br />
          And maybe... beautifully.
        </p>

        <h2>The Chaos Era: Building in the Dark</h2>

        <p>
          They don’t tell you that real building — real becoming — looks
          anything like the montages in the movies.
        </p>

        <p>
          It’s not just neat whiteboards and aesthetic coffee shops. It’s 3AM
          breakdowns. It’s debugging the same stupid error for five hours
          straight. It’s wondering if you’ve lost your mind for thinking you
          could do this at all.
        </p>

        <p>
          But it’s also magic. The kind you have to earn. The kind that only
          shows up when you’re stubborn enough to stay through the mess.
        </p>

        <p>
          There’s a kind of alchemy in making a mess — in building without a
          map, in throwing yourself into the deep end, with only stubbornness
          and half a cup of cold coffee to keep you afloat.
        </p>

        <p>
          This was my chaos era. Not glamorous. Not perfect. Not clean. It was
          gritty. Exhausting. Unfiltered.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was nights of staring at broken code until my vision blurred.
          Sketching designs on the backs of receipts. Starting projects I wasn’t
          ready for, and finishing ones nobody believed in.
        </p>

        <p>
          I was knee-deep in late-night ideas, abandoned drafts, half-broken
          code, and dreams so big they barely fit inside my chest. I designed. I
          broke things. I rebuilt them uglier. Then rebuilt them better.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was failing — spectacularly — and learning anyway. It was hitting
          walls and choosing, every single time, to climb instead of quit.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sometimes it felt like throwing paper planes into a hurricane, hoping
          something would fly. But every mistake, every failure, every crash
          landing taught me something the clean, easy paths never could:
        </p>

        <p>
          ✨ Ideas don’t come fully-formed. <br />✨ They show up messy,
          stubborn, wild — and if you're brave enough to wrestle them into
          existence, they can become something brilliant.
        </p>

        <p>
          And along the way, I learned: <br />
          ⚡ How to stand up without applause. <br />
          ⚡ How to bet on myself when no one was watching. <br />
          ⚡ How to keep choosing the chaos — because it meant I was alive, I
          was moving, I was becoming.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the middle of the madness, between the crashes and the caffeine and
          the quiet moments of "maybe I'm not enough," I found something that
          mattered more than perfection:
        </p>

        <p><strong>Momentum.</strong></p>

        <p>
          Because if you keep moving, even through the storm, even when you’re
          stumbling — you're still building something.
        </p>

        <p>You're still becoming someone.</p>

        <p>This wasn’t the pretty part of the story. But it was the realest.</p>

        <p>
          It was the era where I stopped waiting for permission. Where I
          realized that “figuring it out” wasn’t a destination — it was a
          devotion.
        </p>

        <p>
          The chaos wasn’t a detour. It was the crucible. The place where raw
          dreams burned into real foundations.
        </p>

        <p>
          This was where I stopped waiting for "ready." And started becoming
          unstoppable.
        </p>

        <p>Messy. Beautiful. Unfinished. But moving.</p>

        <p><strong>Always moving.</strong></p>

        <h2>Noctavent: Stardust, Code, and the Courage to Begin</h2>

        <p>Some things aren’t built at noon, under the safe light of reason.</p>
        <p>
          Some things are born between heartbeats — between the hours when the
          world is asleep, and the sky is wide and waiting.
        </p>

        <p>
          Noctavent wasn’t an idea. It was a rebellion. Against silence. Against
          invisibility. Against every voice that said "wait your turn."
        </p>

        <p>
          It was born in the quiet violence of ambition — that soft, aching
          hunger for more. More meaning. More magic. More nights that felt like
          the beginning of something vast and impossible and beautiful.
        </p>

        <p>
          I didn’t sit down and "start a startup." I stayed up, night after
          night, writing dreams into existence with shaky hands and stubborn
          hope.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>✦ Code that pulsed like a heartbeat.</li>
          <li>✦ Designs that carried constellations in their lines.</li>
          <li>
            ✦ Ideas stitched together with chaos, courage, and the kind of faith
            you only find in the dark.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Noctavent is for the ones who dare to build while the world blinks.
          For the architects of wonder. For the alchemists of sleeplessness.
        </p>

        <p>
          This isn’t just a project. It’s a revolution whispered through the
          night sky. It’s proof that the best things we build are often the ones
          no one else sees coming.
        </p>

        <p>
          And if I had to do it all over again — the exhaustion, the fear, the
          3AM meltdowns? I would. In a heartbeat.
        </p>

        <p>
          Because some dreams aren't meant to wait for daylight. They’re meant
          to rise in the dark. Like stars. Like Noctavent. Like me.

        <h2>Future Plans: Building the Dream</h2>

        <p>Some people chase success.</p>
        <p>I’m building something bigger.</p>

        <p>
          I’m building a life that’s equal parts empire and art — a global
          playground for ideas, innovation, and soul-led creation.
        </p>

        <p>
          The plan isn’t just to launch startups, write code, or design pretty
          things. It’s to create spaces that feel like home for the dreamers,
          the disruptors, the believers in magic and strategy alike.
        </p>

        <p>
          I want Noctavent — and everything after it — to be more than brands. I
          want it to be movements. Invitations. A reminder that you can build
          wildly ambitious dreams without burning out your heart in the process.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>🌍 Build globally, lead locally, love endlessly.</li>
          <li>
            👑 Empower others to believe that softness is strength, and empathy
            is a superpower.
          </li>
          <li>💬 Tell stories that last longer than I do.</li>
          <li>
            🌌 Leave places better than I found them — digitally, emotionally,
            cosmically.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>I’m not chasing a title, a number, or a hollow victory.</p>

        <p>
          I’m chasing meaning. Legacy. The quiet revolution of living wide open
          — and building as if wonder still matters.
        </p>

        <p>And someday soon, when they say my name, I hope they say:</p>
